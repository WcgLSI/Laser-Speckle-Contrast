# Laser-Speckle-Contrast
Processing Procedure of Laser Speckle Contrast，matlab
The main program has two：main program（1）,System calibration and main program（2）,Sample measurement。
The two programs are independent of each other. The data of the first program can be read into the second program, or the parameters of the second program can be set by itself.
In the program, there is a program to read data in raw format. If the data is in other formats, it will replace the program with the corresponding format.
This program is a data demodulation method. If multiple data are needed, add loop structure on this basis.
